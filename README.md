# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Twitter-API
The objective of this program is to analyse Donald Trump's tweets and classify the sentiment as either positive, negative or neutral. I have used the Twitter API to fetch the tweets and TextBlob library for performing the NLP task. It includes tokenisation, removing special character and irrelevant nouns and pronouns(stopwords) and passing the tokens to the sentiment classifer which assigns the tweets polarity of positive, negative and neutral by the values 1, -1 and 0 respectively.
